# jenkinsstack

Ignore me.

Stack used to configure a jenkins master and any number of jenkins slaves. By default, the stack uses SSH slaves (master initiated) as opposed to JNLP slaves (slave initiated). The master generates a private key that is used for jenkins authentication as well as passwordless SSH from master to slaves.

## Disclaimers

Changing of Jenkins SSH key pairs should be considered unsupported.  If a specific SSH key is desired, please add this before the initial buildout.  It is possible to manually change this, but it does require manual changes on the server.

## [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

See CHANGELOG.md for additional information about changes to this stack over time.

## Supported Platforms

Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, CentOS 6.5

## Usage

### jenkinsstack::default

Nothing. This recipe is empty.

### jenkinsstack::java

Calls the jenkins cookbook's java recipe.

### jenkinsstack::master

Configures a Jenkins master. Configures any slaves found using Chef search (slaves are found based on tags used in jenkinsstack::slave).

### jenkinsstack::slave

Configures a Jenkins slave.

### jenkinsstack::ruby

Configures ruby with version `node['jenkinsstack']['server_ruby']` and gems from `['jenkinsstack']['ruby_gems']`. This recipe must be included separately, and is intended to help configure a build environment that uses bundler to run things like rake or test-kitchen.

### jenkinsstack::find_all

Used to populate `['jenkinsstack']['all']` for wrapper cookbooks. Aids in writing IP tables rules for SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443).

### jenkinsstack::_nginx

Normally, there wouldn't be a call out for recipes just used within in the cookbook, but this one bears specific notes. It configures an nginx reverse proxy with basic auth over a self-signed SSL certificate. You will almost certainly want to configure something specific to an app cookbook or customer to listen on 80/443 and proxy to :8080 with appropriate SSL certificates and configuring appropriate authentication for jenkins (these are defaults). Note that by default, jenkins ***does not*** secure itself. You should ***immediately*** login to a new jenkins master and turn on a specific authentication method, even if it is simply the builtin. This recipe prevents needing to do that for most testing and development work with test-kitchen.
